They change colour, become lighter, increase in volume and acquire more aroma.  It is precisely with this knowledge of high-temperature roasting, the company ensures that the correct roasting processes. When they reach the peak of perfection, they are quickly cooled to stop the process.  Roasted beans smell like coffee, and weigh less because the moisture has been roasted out. They are crunchy to the bite, ready to be ground and brewed.Once roasted, however, they should be used as quickly as possible before the fresh roast flavor begins to diminish.
